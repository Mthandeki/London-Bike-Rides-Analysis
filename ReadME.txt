The following project is a brief analysis of the trends in bike rides in London and how weather and the time of the day affect the number of bike rides. This project involves the manipulation of a Kaggle data set, the conversion of a Python data frame to an Excel file, and the visualization of the data in Tableau.
Book1 contains the visualization of the dataset and can be opened using Tableau.
